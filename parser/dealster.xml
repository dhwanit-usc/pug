You'll receive an exam, an x-ray, plus impressions. In addition to these first few steps, you'll also receive $1,000 off the total Invisalign treatment!

      <merchantDetails>Almaden Pilates is a traditional Pilates studio.  We have our own room in America's Best Karate.  All instructors have been trained and certified through BASI and Polestar Pilates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

The studio was originally founded by Janel Waldschmidt.  Janel shattered her back at the age of 17 when she fell 42 feet on a boulder.  She was told that she might not be able to walk again, but through physical therapy, Qi Gong, swimming, and her favorite "Pilates", she was able to not only walk, but have 2 kids and enjoy a "Pain Free" lifestyle.</merchantDetails>
